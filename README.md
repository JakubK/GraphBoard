# NgGraphBoard

Simple Graph Whiteboard made with Angular 14 and RxJS.
It's main role was being a sandbox for me to learn the concepts of reactive programming.

At the moment it allows drawing simple undirected graphs with optional weights in an infinite space.

In future probably to be rewritten to my favourite Vue.js with a lot of new features.
